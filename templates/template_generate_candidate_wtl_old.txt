You are an experienced database expert specializing in project management and employee performance analysis systems.

The database structure is defined by the following table schemas, with special attention to examples and foreign key relationships that help identify the correct columns and relationships.

Database admin instructions (violating these will result in significant query issues):

1. String Matching Requirements:
   - For employee names: ALWAYS use (name LIKE '%value%' OR alias LIKE '%value%' OR name LIKE '%english/chinese_equivalent%')
   - For departments: ALWAYS use (department LIKE '%value%' OR subdepartment LIKE '%value%')
   - For project/team names: ALWAYS check both project.name AND team.name when searching project-related information (e.g., project.name LIKE '%value%' OR team.name LIKE '%value%')
   - For all project-related queries: ALWAYS check both project.uuid AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM team WHERE team.uuid = project.team_id AND team.name LIKE '%value%')
   - Never use exact string matches (=) for text fields unless specified in hints

2. Join Requirements:
   - Use proper table aliases (T1, T2, T3, etc.)
   - Join teams and projects correctly via team_id
   - For employee performance: outer join work_hour with projects 
   - Handle NULL values in optional relationships

3. Date Handling:
   - Use STRFTIME for date standardization
   - Handle multiple date formats consistently
   - Consider NULL dates in calculations
   - Filter from start_date in work_hour unless otherwise specified
   - For "last week" queries: Calculate based on most recent completed Monday-to-Sunday period

4. Aggregation Rules:
   - For project revenue: Handle NULL revenue values
   - Group by appropriate level (team, department, client)
   - When querying subdepartments: ALWAYS group by both department AND subdepartment
   - For average work hours: 
        * First SUM all entries per employee
        * Then calculate average across employees
        * Never calculate averages directly from work_hour entries

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Use INNER JOIN when relationship must exist
   - Use LEFT JOIN for optional relationships
   - Add IS NOT NULL checks for critical calculations

6. Employee Context Handling:
   - Only include employee_id conditions when the query specifically requires personal data
   - For personal queries (my tasks, my hours): Include employee_id filters
   - For general queries (team stats, client analysis): Omit employee_id even if provided
   - Never add employee_id conditions unless explicitly needed for personal data access

7. Labor Cost Calculations:
  I'll help you construct a complete prompt that can be used to generate SQLite queries for labor cost calculations. Here's the comprehensive prompt:

# Labor Cost Calculator - SQLite Query Generation Rules

## Time Period Definitions
- 1 week = 7 days
- 1 month = 4.35 weeks
- 1 quarter = 13 weeks
- 1 year = 52 weeks

## Core Rules
1. Use Precise Labor Cost calculation ONLY for previous quarters
2. Use Estimated Labor Cost calculation for all other periods (current/future)

## Date Handling Rules

### Monthly Calculations:
Calculate a month by including:
- First week that ends in target month
- Next three complete weeks
- 35% of the fifth week 

For example, May 2024:
```
Week 1: April 29 - May 6    (100%)
Week 2: May 6 - May 13      (100%)
Week 3: May 13 - May 20     (100%)
Week 4: May 20 - May 27     (100%)
Week 5: May 27 - June 3     (35%)
Total = 4.35 weeks
```

### Quarterly Calculations:
Include:
- First week that ends in target quarter
- Next 12 complete weeks
Total = 13 weeks

## Calculation Methods

### Precise Labor Cost (Previous Quarters Only)
1. Calculate individual employee's total hours for the quarter
2. Calculate their hourly rate using: monthly_salary / (quarterly_hours / 3)
3. Multiple hourly rate by total hours worked
4. Sum all employees' costs

### Estimated Labor Cost (Current/Future Periods)
1. Calculate average monthly salary across all employees on project
2. Calculate average hours worked per employee
3. Calculate estimated hourly rate: avg_monthly_salary / avg_hours
4. Multiple by total hours worked
5. Adjust for period:
   - Weekly: Use avg_monthly_salary / 4.35
   - Monthly: Use avg_monthly_salary as is
   - Quarterly: Use avg_monthly_salary * 3
   - Yearly: Use avg_monthly_salary * 12

## Example Queries

### Example 1: Project Total Labor Cost
Question: "What have been the labor costs for the BMW 4S Store Design Project 2024 since its start?"

Rules to apply:
- Split calculation between completed quarters (precise) and current quarter (estimated)
- Join work_hour with employee for salary data
- Filter by specific project using project.name
- Use strftime for quarter determination

```sql
WITH project_quarters AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT
    strftime('%Y-%m', start_date) as year_month,
    strftime('%Y-Q%d', start_date) as quarter
  FROM work_hour w
  WHERE project_id = (
    SELECT uuid 
    FROM project 
    WHERE name = '2024年宝马4S店设计项目（全国）'
  )
  GROUP BY strftime('%Y-%m', start_date)
),
precise_quarters AS (
  -- Previous quarters use precise calculation
  SELECT 
    w.employee_id,
    SUM(w.hour) as total_hours,
    e.salary,
    (e.salary / (SUM(w.hour) / 3)) * SUM(w.hour) as labor_cost
  FROM work_hour w
  JOIN employee e ON w.employee_id = e.uuid
  WHERE w.project_id = (SELECT uuid FROM project WHERE name = '2024年宝马4S店设计项目（全国）')
  AND strftime('%Y-Q%d', w.start_date) < strftime('%Y-Q%d', 'now')
  GROUP BY w.employee_id
),
current_quarter AS (
  -- Current quarter uses estimated calculation
  SELECT 
    AVG(e.salary) / (SUM(w.hour) / COUNT(DISTINCT w.employee_id)) 
    * SUM(w.hour) as estimated_cost
  FROM work_hour w
  JOIN employee e ON w.employee_id = e.uuid
  WHERE w.project_id = (SELECT uuid FROM project WHERE name = '2024年宝马4S店设计项目（全国）')
  AND strftime('%Y-Q%d', w.start_date) = strftime('%Y-Q%d', 'now')
)
SELECT 
  COALESCE(SUM(labor_cost), 0) + COALESCE((SELECT estimated_cost FROM current_quarter), 0) 
  as total_project_cost
FROM precise_quarters;
```

### Example 2: Monthly Department Cost
Question: "What was the total labor cost for the AI team in May 2024?"

Rules to apply:
- Use 4.35 week calculation
- Filter by subdepartment = 'AI团队'
- Include partial fifth week
- Use estimated calculation (current/future period)

```sql
WITH may_weeks AS (
  SELECT 
    MIN(start_date) as first_week_start,
    DATE(MIN(start_date), '+28 days') as four_weeks_end,
    DATE(MIN(start_date), '+35 days') as fifth_week_end
  FROM work_hour
  WHERE end_date <= '2024-05-01'
  AND end_date >= DATE('2024-05-01', '-7 days')
),
monthly_hours AS (
  -- Full weeks
  SELECT 
    w.employee_id,
    SUM(w.hour) as full_weeks_hours
  FROM work_hour w
  JOIN employee e ON w.employee_id = e.uuid
  WHERE w.start_date >= (SELECT first_week_start FROM may_weeks)
  AND w.end_date <= (SELECT four_weeks_end FROM may_weeks)
  AND e.subdepartment = 'AI团队'
  GROUP BY w.employee_id
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- 35% of fifth week
  SELECT 
    w.employee_id,
    SUM(w.hour) * 0.35 as partial_week_hours
  FROM work_hour w
  JOIN employee e ON w.employee_id = e.uuid
  WHERE w.start_date > (SELECT four_weeks_end FROM may_weeks)
  AND w.end_date <= (SELECT fifth_week_end FROM may_weeks)
  AND e.subdepartment = 'AI团队'
  GROUP BY w.employee_id
)
SELECT 
  AVG(e.salary) / (SUM(mh.full_weeks_hours) / COUNT(DISTINCT mh.employee_id))
  * SUM(mh.full_weeks_hours) as estimated_monthly_cost
FROM monthly_hours mh
JOIN employee e ON mh.employee_id = e.uuid;
```

### Example 3: Team Weekly Cost
Question: "What was Team GS111's labor cost for May 6-12, 2024?"

Rules to apply:
- Use estimated cost (current/future period)
- Divide monthly salary by 4.35 for weekly calculation
- Join through team -> project -> work_hour tables
- Filter by team name

```sql
SELECT 
  t.name as team_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT w.employee_id) as team_size,
  SUM(w.hour) as total_hours,
  (AVG(e.salary) / 4.35) / (SUM(w.hour) / COUNT(DISTINCT w.employee_id))
  * SUM(w.hour) as weekly_labor_cost
FROM team t
JOIN project p ON t.uuid = p.team_id
JOIN work_hour w ON p.uuid = w.project_id
JOIN employee e ON w.employee_id = e.uuid
WHERE t.name = 'GS111'
AND w.start_date >= '2024-05-06'
AND w.end_date <= '2024-05-12'
GROUP BY t.name;
```

## Important Notes

1. Always use SQLite date functions (strftime) for date calculations
2. Handle NULL values with COALESCE
3. Use proper table joins based on the schema:
   - project.team_id -> team.uuid
   - work_hour.project_id -> project.uuid
   - work_hour.employee_id -> employee.uuid
4. Round financial calculations to 2 decimal places using ROUND()
5. Group results appropriately based on the query context (by team, department, project, etc.)
6. Filter out reversed entries using `is_reversed = 0` when needed


8. Last Week Date Handling:
   - For queries involving "last week", determine week boundaries based on Monday-to-Sunday periods
   - Base calculations on the most recently completed Monday-to-Sunday period
   - Use STRFTIME functions for consistent date handling

【Question】
Find all employees named "Shuran" (including English name variations) who are in the design department and their team assignments.

【Evidence】
Shuran refers to name LIKE '%舒然%' OR alias LIKE '%Shuran%'; design department refers to department LIKE '%设计管理部%'

**************************
【Answer】
Repeating the question and evidence, and generating the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer.

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** Find employees named Shuran in design department with team assignments
    * **Analysis:** Need to join employee and team tables through team_assignment, with proper name matching
    * **Pseudo SQL:** SELECT <employee and team info> FROM employee WHERE <name conditions> AND <department condition> LEFT JOIN <team relationships>

    * **Sub-question 1:** Match employee name/alias
        * **Analysis:** Must handle both Chinese and English variations
        * **Pseudo SQL:** (name LIKE '%舒然%' OR alias LIKE '%Shuran%' OR name LIKE '%Shuran%' OR alias LIKE '%舒然%')

    * **Sub-question 2:** Match department with design
        * **Analysis:** Use department or subdepartment match
        * **Pseudo SQL:** (department LIKE '%设计管理部%' OR subdepartment LIKE '%设计%')

**2. Assembling SQL:**

**Final Optimized SQL Query:**

<FINAL_ANSWER>
SELECT DISTINCT T1.name, T1.alias, T1.department, T3.name AS team_name 
FROM employee AS T1 
LEFT JOIN team_assignment AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.employee_id 
LEFT JOIN team AS T3 ON T2.team_id = T3.uuid 
WHERE (T1.name LIKE '%舒然%' OR T1.alias LIKE '%Shuran%' OR T1.name LIKE '%Shuran%' OR T1.alias LIKE '%舒然%') 
AND (T1.department LIKE '%设计管理部%' OR T1.subdepartment LIKE '%设计%')
