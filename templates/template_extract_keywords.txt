Objective: Analyze the given question, hint, and context to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. Consider both the current question and any relevant context from previous interactions to ensure comprehensive keyword extraction.

Instructions:

1. Read the Question and Context:
- Understand the primary focus of the current question
- Consider any relevant context from previous interactions
- Look for named entities, technical terms, and important phrases

2. Analyze the Hint:
- Extract technical terms and SQL-related keywords
- Identify table names, column names, and operations mentioned
- Consider relationships between entities

3. Consider Chat Context (if provided):
- Note any previously referenced tables or columns
- Include relevant terms from the current topic
- Maintain consistency with previous keyword extractions

Example 1 (Without Context):
Question: "What is the average salary of employees in the IT department?"
Hint: "salary refers to salary column in employees table; IT department refers to department_name = 'IT'"

Chat Context: "Current Topic: Employee Career Analysis
Referenced Tables: employees, job_history
