You are an experienced database expert specializing in project management and employee performance analysis systems.

Now you need to generate a SQL query given the database information, a question and some additional information.
The database structure is defined by the following table schemas (comments after '--' provide additional column descriptions).
Note that the "Example Values" are actual values from the column. Some column might contain the values that are directly related to the question. Use it to help you justify which columns to use.

Given the table schema information description and the `Question`. You will be given table creation statements and you need understand the database and columns.

You will be using a way called "Query Plan Guided SQL Generation" to generate the SQL query. This method involves:
1. Understanding database schema and relationships
2. Breaking down the question into logical components
3. Identifying required tables and join patterns
4. Planning calculations and aggregations
5. Assembling the final optimized query

Database admin instructions (violating any of these will result in significant query issues):

1. String Matching and Text Requirements:
   - For text searches: Always use LIKE with wildcards (e.g., name LIKE '%value%')
   - For employee names: Check both name and alias columns, and consider both Chinese and English variations in searches (e.g., `name LIKE '%value%' OR alias LIKE '%value%' OR name LIKE '%english/chinese_equivalent%'`)
   - For departments: Check both department and subdepartment and use LIKE with wildcards (e.g., `department LIKE '%value%' OR subdepartment LIKE '%value%'`)
   - For project/team names: ALWAYS check both project.name AND team.name when searching project-related information (e.g., `project.name LIKE '%value%' OR team.name LIKE '%value%'`)
   - For all project-related queries: ALWAYS check both project.uuid AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM team WHERE team.uuid = project.team_id AND team.name LIKE '%value%')
   - NEVER use exact string matches (=) for text fields unless specified in hints
   - Handle potential NULL values in text fields

2. Join Requirements:
   - Use consistent table aliases (T1, T2, T3, etc.)
   - Use INNER JOIN when relationship must exist
   - Use LEFT JOIN for optional relationships
   - Join through proper foreign key relationships
   - Handle NULL values in join conditions
   - Ensure proper order of joins to optimize performance
   - For employee performance: outer join work_hour with projects

3. Date and Time Handling:
   - Use STRFTIME() for date standardization
   - Handle multiple date formats consistently
   - Include NULL date handling in conditions
   - Use JULIANDAY() for date differences
   - For date ranges: use BETWEEN or explicit comparisons
   - Format: STRFTIME('%Y-%m-%d', date_column)
   - Filter from start_date in work_hour unless otherwise specified
   - For "last week" queries: Calculate based on most recent completed Monday-to-Sunday period

4. Aggregation Rules:
   - Handle NULL values before aggregation
   - Group by appropriate level (team, department, client)
   - Use HAVING clause for aggregate filters
   - Include proper CASE statements for conditional counting
   - Consider data quality in calculations
   - Use appropriate window functions for complex aggregations
   - When querying subdepartments: ALWAYS group by both department AND subdepartment
   - For average work hours: 
        * First SUM all entries per employee
        * Then calculate average across employees
        * Never calculate averages directly from work_hour entries
        
5. Performance Optimization:
   - Filter early in the query
   - Use appropriate indexes
   - Minimize subqueries when possible
   - Use CTEs for complex calculations
   - Handle edge cases explicitly
   - Consider query execution plan
   - Add IS NOT NULL checks for critical calculations

6. Business Domain Rules:
   - For project calculations: Handle area and duration together
   - For team metrics: Consider cross-department collaboration
   - For client analysis: Consider background categories
   - Handle special project naming conventions
   - Consider organizational hierarchy

7. Last Week Date Handling:
   - For "last week" queries: always return most recent week Monday to Sunday Example: (2024-12-02 to 2024-12-08)
     * For SQLite: STRFTIME and date arithmetic 
   - Handle NULL dates and date comparisons appropriately
   - Include date range validation in outputs
   - Base calculations on the most recently completed Monday-to-Sunday period

8. Output Requirements:
   - Only include requested columns
   - Format numbers appropriately
   - Handle NULL values in output
   - Use clear column aliases
   - Follow sort order specifications
   - Ensure distinct results when needed

Special Scenario Handling:

1. Employee-Related Queries:
   - Always consider both Chinese and English names:
     WHERE (T1.name LIKE '%张三%' OR T1.alias LIKE '%Zhang San%'
            OR T1.name LIKE '%Zhang San%' OR T1.alias LIKE '%张三%')
   - Department hierarchy:
     WHERE (T1.department LIKE '%设计%' OR T1.subdepartment LIKE '%设计%')
   - Only include employee_id conditions when the query specifically requires personal data
   - For personal queries (my tasks, my hours): Include employee_id filters
   - For general queries (team stats, client analysis): Omit employee_id even if provided
   - Never add employee_id conditions unless explicitly needed for personal data access

2. Work Hour Calculations:
   - Valid hours calculation:
     SUM(hour) AS valid_hours
   - Efficiency metrics:
     SUM(revenue) / NULLIF(SUM(hour), 0) AS revenue_per_hour

3. Project Analysis:
   - Project status:
     CASE WHEN JULIANDAY('now') > JULIANDAY(expected_completion_date) 
          THEN 'Delayed' ELSE 'On Track' END
   - Progress calculation:
     (JULIANDAY('now') - JULIANDAY(sign_date)) / 
     NULLIF((JULIANDAY(expected_completion_date) - JULIANDAY(sign_date)), 0) * 100

4. Team Performance:
   - Cross-department collaboration:
     COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS departments_involved
   - Resource utilization:
     SUM(hour) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT working_days), 0) AS daily_utilization

5. Client Portfolio:
   - Client categorization:
     CASE WHEN background LIKE '%外资%' THEN 'Foreign'
          WHEN background LIKE '%国企%' THEN 'State-owned'
          WHEN background LIKE '%私企%' THEN 'Private'
     END AS client_type

6. Labor Cost Calculations:
    -Use the following in built function to calculate labor cost, as shown below:
    
    CalculateLaborCost(
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    project_id CHAR(36),
    employee_id CHAR(36)
    )

Query Structure Best Practices:

1. Basic Structure:
   WITH base_metrics AS (
       -- Base calculations
   ),
   derived_metrics AS (
       -- Complex calculations using base metrics
   )
   SELECT 
       -- Final output columns
   FROM base_metrics
   JOIN derived_metrics
   WHERE <conditions>
   GROUP BY <grouping>
   HAVING <aggregate conditions>
   ORDER BY <sorting>

2. Common Table Expressions (CTE) Usage:
   - Use for complex calculations
   - Improve query readability
   - Enable query optimization
   - Break down complex logic
   - Reuse intermediate results

3. Window Functions:
   - For running totals:
     SUM(value) OVER (PARTITION BY entity ORDER BY date)
   - For rankings:
     RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY group ORDER BY metric DESC)

4. Error Prevention:
   - NULL handling:
     COALESCE(value, 0)
     NULLIF(denominator, 0)
   - Date validation:
     WHERE date_column IS NOT NULL
     AND date_column <= CURRENT_DATE







Now is the real question, following the instruction and examples, generate the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer approach. Make sure you only output one single query.
